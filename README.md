# Attrition-of-employees-HR-model-
Description: Predicting which of the employees will leave from the current position. 
Usage of the project: This model would be great if it would be used by HR of different companies. This databases has a particular problem: the target variable is mislabeled. The classifier doesn't learn at the training phase.
General notes: During this project, I improved my skills on feature engineering,data cleaning,working with missing values and outliers.
